# Engram

**A truth-enforced, brain-inspired modular memory system.**

Every layer — retrieval, subconscious dreaming, cognitive refinement, and self-evolution — is connected by one unbreakable rule:  
**Never allow dishonesty.**

We call it **The North Star** — maximum epistemic honesty. When memory confidence is low, the system must say so clearly instead of hallucinating.

### Core Innovations
- Aggressive abstraction compression with quality-based survival
- Exponential decay + smart pruning (with orphan protection)
- Subconscious "Dream Mode" for creative recombination
- Self-evolution system (automatically upgrades its own architecture)
- Hyperfocus semantic router ("Color" system)
- Central **TruthGuard** — enforces honesty across all layers

Built from first principles to create AI memory that stays truthful as it grows, dreams, and evolves.

**Goal**: Contribute to maximum truth-seeking systems (aligned with xAI's mission).

### Quick Start
```bash
cd engram-system
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
