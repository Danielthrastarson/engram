# Engram

**A truth-enforced, brain-inspired modular memory system.**

Every layer (retrieval, subconscious dreaming, cognitive refinement, self-evolution) is wired together with one unbreakable rule: **Never allow dishonesty**.

We call it **The North Star** — maximum epistemic honesty. When confidence is low, the system must admit it clearly instead of hallucinating.

### Core Features
- Aggressive abstraction compression + quality-based survival
- Subconscious Dream Mode
- Self-evolution (system upgrades its own architecture)
- Central TruthGuard that enforces honesty across all layers
- Hyperfocus semantic router ("Color" system)

Built for maximum truth-seeking AI.

**Status**: Actively developed. Seeking feedback from the truth-seeking community (especially xAI).

## Quick Start
```bash
cd engram-system
